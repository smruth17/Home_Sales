# Home_Sales
Homework for Module 22
For this challenge, I used SparkSQL to determine metrics about home sales. I created temporary views based on specific criteria, partitioned the data, cached and uncached a temporary table, and verified that the table was uncached. Four queries were used, but then I tracked the run time for the last query, as well as on a cached temporary table, and a temporary table of the parquet data. The cached temporary table had the lowest runtime.
